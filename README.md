## Universal RNN
Given a description of a p-stack Turing machine (as transition maps $\beta$'s and $\gamma$'s), simulate the computation using
1. A dynamical system over rationals
2. A recurrent neural network with rational weights

The project is a single notebook file, which explains the construction step-by-step.


The only dependency to run the project is ``numpy``
